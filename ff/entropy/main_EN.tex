\section[Analyzing using information entropy]{Analyzing unknown binary files using information entropy}
\label{entropy}
\myindex{Entropy}

For the sake of simplification, I would say, information entropy is a measure, how tightly some piece of data can be compressed.
For example, it is usually not possible to compress already compressed archive file, so it has high entropy.
On the other hand, one megabyte of zero bytes can be compressed to a tiny output file.
Indeed, in plain English language, one million of zeros can be described just as ``resulting file is one million zero bytes''.
Compressed files are usually a list of instructions to decompressor, like this: ``put 1000 zeros, then 0x23 byte, then 0x45 byte, then put a block of size 10 bytes which we've seen 500 bytes back, etc.''

Texts written in natural languages are also can be compressed tightly, 
because natural languages has a lot of redundancy
(otherwise, a tiny typo will always lead to misunderstanding, 
like any toggled bit in compressed archive make decompression nearly impossible), 
some words are used very often, etc.
It's possible to drop some words and text will be still readable.

Code for CPUs is also can be compressed, because some ISA instructions are used much more often than others.
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!MOV}
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!PUSH}
\myindex{x86!\Instructions!CALL}
In x86, most used instructions are MOV/PUSH/CALL---indeed, most of the time, computer CPU is just shuffling data and switching between
levels of abstractions.
If to consider data shuffling as moving data between levels of abstractions, this is also part of switching.

Data compressors and encryptors tend to produce very high entropy results.
Good pseudorandom number generators also produce data which cannot be compressed 
(it is possible to measure their quality by this sign).

So, in other words, entropy is a measure which can help to probe unknown data block.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Information entropy can be used as a quick-n-dirty method for inspecting unknown binary files.
In particular, it is a very quick way to find compressed/encrypted pieces of data.
Someone say it's possible to find RSA (and other asymmetric cryptographic algorithms) public/private keys 
in executable code (which has high entropy as well), but I didn't try this myself.

\subsection{Tools}

Handy Linux \IT{ent} utility to measure entropy of a file\footnote{\url{http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/}}.

There is a great online entropy visualizer made by Aldo Cortesi, 
which I tried to mimic using Mathematica: \url{http://binvis.io}.
His articles about entropy visualization are worth reading:
\url{http://corte.si/posts/visualisation/entropy/index.html},
\url{http://corte.si/posts/visualisation/malware/index.html},
\url{http://corte.si/posts/visualisation/binvis/index.html}.

\myindex{radare2}
radare2 framework has \IT{\#entropy} command for this.

A tool for IDA: IDAtropy\footnote{\url{https://github.com/danigargu/IDAtropy}}.

\subsection{A word about primitive encryption like XORing}

It's interesting that simple XOR encryption doesn't affect entropy of data.
I've shown this in \IT{Norton Guide} example in the book (\myref{norton_guide}).

Generalizing: encryption by substitution cipher also doesn't affect entropy of data (and XOR can be viewed as substitution cipher).
The reason of that is because entropy calculation algorithm view data on byte-level.
On the other hand, the data encrypted by 2 or 4-byte XOR pattern will result in another entropy.

Nevertheless, low entropy is usually a good sign of weak amateur cryptography
(which is also used in license keys, license files, etc.).

\subsection{More about entropy of executable code}

It is quickly noticeable that probably a biggest source of high-entropy in executable code are relative offsets encoded in opcodes.
For example, these two consequent instructions will produce different relative offsets in their opcodes, 
while they are in fact pointing to the same function:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86]
function proc
...
function endp

...

CALL function
...
CALL function
\end{lstlisting}

Ideal executable code compressor would encode information like this:
\IT{there is a CALL to a ``function'' at address X and the same CALL at address Y} without necessity to encode
address of the \IT{function} twice.

\myindex{UPX}
To deal with this, executable compressors are sometimes able to reduce entropy here.
One example is UPX: \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/upx/code/ci/default/tree/doc/filter.txt}.

\subsection{Random number generators}

\myindex{GnuPG}
When I run GnuPG to generate new secret key, it asking for some entropy...

\begin{lstlisting}
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 169 more bytes)
\end{lstlisting}

This means that good a PRNG produces long high-entropy results, and this is what the secret asymetrical cryptographical key needs.
But \ac{CPRNG} is tricky (because computer is highly deterministic device itself),
so the GnuPG asking for some additional randomness from the user.

Here is a case where I made attempt to calculate entropy of some unknown blocks: \myref{encrypted_DB1}.

\subsection{Entropy of various files}

Entropy of random bytes is close to 8:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape]
$\$$ dd bs=1M count=1 if=/dev/urandom | ent
Entropy = 7.999803 bits per byte.
\end{lstlisting}

This means, almost all available space inside of byte is filled with information.

256 bytes in range of 0..255 gives exact value of 8:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape,style=custompy]
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

for i in range(256):
    sys.stdout.write(chr(i))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape]
python 1.py | ent
Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.
\end{lstlisting}

Order of bytes doesn't matter.
This means, all available space inside of byte is filled.

Entropy of all zero bytes is 0:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape]
$\$$ dd bs=1M count=1 if=/dev/zero | ent
Entropy = 0.000000 bits per byte.
\end{lstlisting}

Entropy of a string costisting of a single (any) byte is 0:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape]
$\$$ echo -n "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" | ent
Entropy = 0.000000 bits per byte.
\end{lstlisting}

\myindex{base64}
Entropy of base64 string is the same as entropy of source data, but multiplied by $\frac{3}{4}$.
This is because base64 encoding uses 64 symbols instead of 256.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape]
$\$$ dd bs=1M count=1 if=/dev/urandom | base64 | ent
Entropy = 6.022068 bits per byte.
\end{lstlisting}

Perhaps, 6.02 not that close to 6 because padding symbols (\TT{=}) spoils our statistics for a little.

\myindex{Uuencode}
Uuencode, also uses 64 symbols:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape]
$\$$ dd bs=1M count=1 if=/dev/urandom | uuencode - | ent
Entropy = 6.013162 bits per byte.
\end{lstlisting}

This means, any base64 and Uuencode strings can be transmitted using 6-bit bytes or characters.

Any random information in hexadecimal form has entropy of 4 bits per byte:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily, mathescape]
$\$$ openssl rand -hex $\$$(( 2**16 )) | ent
Entropy = 4.000013 bits per byte.
\end{lstlisting}

Entropy of randomly picked English language text from Gutenberg library has entropy ~4.5.
The reason of this is because English texts uses mostly 26 symbols, and $log_2(26)=~4.7$, i.e., you would need
5-bit bytes to transmit uncompressed English texts, that would be enough (it was indeed so in teletype era).

Randomly chosen Russian language text from \url{http://lib.ru}
library is F.M.Dostoevsky ``Idiot''\footnote{\url{http://az.lib.ru/d/dostoewskij_f_m/text_0070.shtml}},
internally encoded in CP1251 encoding.

And this file has entropy of ~4.98.
Russian language has 33 characters, and $log_2(33)=~5.04$.
But it has unpopular and rare ``ё'' character
% FIXME YO letter isn't rendered in Eng version
\footnote{When I typed it here in text, I've needed to look down to my keyboard and find it.}.
And $log_2(32)=5$ (Russian alphabet without this rare character) --- now this close to what we've got.

In fact, the text we studying uses ``ё'' letter, but, probably, it's still rarely used there.

\myindex{UTF-8}
The very same file transcoded from CP1251 to UTF-8 gave entropy of ~4.23.
Each Cyrillic character encoded in UTF-8 is usually encoded as a pair,
and the first byte is always one of: 0xD0 or 0xD1.
Perhaps, this caused bias.

Let's generate random bits and output them as ``T'' or ``F'' characters:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=custompy]
#!/usr/bin/env python
import random, sys

rt=""
for i in range(102400):
    if random.randint(0,1)==1:
        rt=rt+"T"
    else:
        rt=rt+"F"
print rt
\end{lstlisting}

Sample: \TT{...TTTFTFTTTFFFTTTFTTTTTTFTTFFTTTFTFTTFTTFFFFFF...}.

Entropy is very close to 1 (i.e., 1 bit per byte).

Let's generate random decimal numbers:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=custompy]
#!/usr/bin/env python
import random, sys

rt=""
for i in range(102400):
    rt=rt+"%d" % random.randint(0,9)
print rt
\end{lstlisting}

Sample: \TT{...52203466119390328807552582367031963888032...}.

Entropy will be close to 3.32, indeed, this is $log_2(10)$.

\subsection{Making lower level of entropy}

The author of these lines once saw a software which stored each byte of encrypted data in 3 bytes:
each has roughly $\frac{byte}{3}$ value, so reconstructing encrypted byte back involving summing up 3 consecutive bytes.
Looks absurdly.

But some people say this was done in order to conceal the very fact
the data has something encrypted inside: measuring entropy of such block will show much lower level of it.
