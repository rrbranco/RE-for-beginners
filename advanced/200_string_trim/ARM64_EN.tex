\subsection{ARM64: \NonOptimizing GCC (Linaro) 4.9}

This implementation is straightforward:

\subsection{ARM64: \Optimizing GCC (Linaro) 4.9}

This is a more advanced optimization.

The first character is loaded at the beginning, and compared against 10 (the \ac{LF} character).

Characters are also loaded in the main loop, for the characters after first one.

This is somewhat similar to the \myref{string_trim_GCC_x64_O3} example.
