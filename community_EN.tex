\chapter{Communities}

There are two excellent \ac{RE}-related subreddits on reddit.com:
\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17027}{reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/} and
\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17028}{reddit.com/r/remath}
(on the topics for the intersection of \ac{RE} and mathematics).

There is also a \ac{RE} part of the Stack Exchange website:
\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17029}{reverseengineering.stackexchange.com}.

On IRC there's a \#\#re channel on
FreeNode\footnote{\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17030}{freenode.net}}.
