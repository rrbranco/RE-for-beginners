\XOR is widely used when one needs just to flip specific bit(s).
Indeed, the \XOR operation applied with 1 effectively inverts a bit:

\input{fundamentals/XOR_table}

And vice-versa, the \XOR operation applied with 0 does nothing, i.e., it's an idle operation.
This is a very important property of the \XOR operation and it's highly recommended to memorize it.
