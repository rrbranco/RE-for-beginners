\subsection{AND/OR/XOR as MOV}

\INS{OR reg, 0xFFFFFFFF} sets all bits to 1, hence, no matter what has been in register before, it will be set to $-1$.
\INS{OR reg, -1} is shorter than \INS{MOV reg, -1}, so MSVC uses OR instead the latter,
for example: \myref{using_OR_instead_of_MOV}.

Likewise, \INS{AND reg, 0} always resets all bits, hence, it acts like \INS{MOV reg, 0}.

\INS{XOR reg, reg}, no matter what has been in register beforehand, resets all bits, and also acts like \INS{MOV reg, 0}.
