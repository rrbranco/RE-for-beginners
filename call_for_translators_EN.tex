You may want to help me with translation this work into languages other than English and Russian.
Just send me any piece of translated text (no matter how short) and I'll put it into my LaTeX source code.

\href{https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners/blob/master/Translation.md}{Read here}.

Speed isn't important, because this is open-source project, after all.
Your name will be mentioned as project contributor.
Korean, Chinese and Persian languages are reserved by publishers.
English and Russian versions I do by myself, but my English is still that horrible, so I'm very grateful for any notes about grammar, etc.
Even my Russian is also flawed, so I'm grateful for notes about Russian text as well!%

So do not hesitate to contact me: \GTT{\EMAIL}.
