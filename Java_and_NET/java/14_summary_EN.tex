\subsection{Summary}

What is missing in Java in comparison to \CCpp?


\begin{itemize}
\item Structures: use classes.

\item Unions: use class hierarchies.

\item Unsigned data types.
By the way, this makes cryptographic algorithms somewhat harder to implement in Java.


\item Function pointers.
\end{itemize}
