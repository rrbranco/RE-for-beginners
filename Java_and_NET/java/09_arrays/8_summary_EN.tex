\subsubsection{Summary}

Is it possible to do a buffer overflow in Java?

No, because the array's length is always present in an array object, 
array bounds are controlled, and an exception is to be raised in case of out-of-bounds access.


There are no multi-dimensional arrays in Java in the \CCpp sense, so Java is not very suited
for fast scientific computations.

%Perhaps it's payback for memory safety, which is absent in \CCpp.
