\subsection{\ShiftsSectionName}

Bit shifts in \CCpp are implemented using $\ll$ and $\gg$ operators.
The x86 \ac{ISA} has the SHL (SHift Left) and SHR (SHift Right) instructions for this.
Shift instructions are often used in division and multiplications by powers of two: $2^{n}$ (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.):
\myref{subsec:mult_using_shifts},
\myref{division_by_shifting}.

% FIXME: rework this

Shifting operations are also so important because they are often used for specific bit isolation
or for constructing a value of several scattered bits.
