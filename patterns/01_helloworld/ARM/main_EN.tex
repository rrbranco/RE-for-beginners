For my experiments with ARM processors, several compilers were used:

\begin{itemize}
\item Popular in the embedded area: Keil Release 6/2013.

\item Apple Xcode 4.6.3 IDE with the LLVM-GCC 4.2 compiler
\footnote{It is indeed so: Apple Xcode 4.6.3 uses open-source GCC as front-end compiler and LLVM 
code generator}.

\item GCC 4.9 (Linaro) (for ARM64), available as win32-executables at \url{http://go.yurichev.com/17325}.

\end{itemize}

32-bit ARM code is used (including Thumb and Thumb-2 modes) in all cases in this book, if not mentioned otherwise.
When we talk about 64-bit ARM here, we call it ARM64.
